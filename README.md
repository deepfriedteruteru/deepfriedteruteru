    ◠◠ ‎ <b>xtra :</b> i think you can tell BUT i LOVEE teruteru, HOWEVER it does not mean I defend him . I'm not gonna go out of my way to call him a saint because he's FAR FROM IT and deserve the hate and criticisms . i love him for reasons outside their weird shit, and i really understand and respect disliking/hating him ( in fact, i'd also jump on the hate train ngl because i love analyzing his character INCLUDING his flaws in writing and morals ) , just please be respectful about my views thx ^_^
